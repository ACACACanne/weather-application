Reflection
Building this app was a journey of blending technical precision with artistic expression. I wanted more than just a weather dashboard, I envisioned an experience that feels alive, poetic, and emotionally resonant.
What I Learned
• 	Modular Design: Breaking the app into reusable components made it easier to maintain and scale.
• 	Responsive Layouts: Designing for all devices taught me how to balance flexibility with clarity.
• 	Poetic UI: Writing weather summaries that evoke emotion helped me explore storytelling through code.

What I’m Proud Of
• 	The way the app feels — not just how it works.
• 	The seamless integration of visuals, motion, and meaning.
• 	The clarity and elegance of the final layout.

What’s Next
• 	Expand the visual library with animated transitions
• 	Add multilingual support for summaries
• 	Explore dynamic overlays based on weather intensity
• 	Modularize the footer and add theme toggles
This app is more than a forecast — it’s a reflection of how I see technology: as a canvas for creativity, clarity, and connection.
